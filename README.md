# Siglent SDS1000X-E/SDS800X-HD/SDS1000X-HD series Bode Plot

Bode plot with Siglent oscilloscopes (SDS1000X-E, SDS800X-HD, SDS1000X-HD, and probably others) and a non-siglent AWG.

Can also be used as a regular VXI-11 front-end for the supported AWGs, without the Siglent scope.

## Overview

At a certain point after getting the SDS1204X-E oscilloscope I started to wonder if it might be possible to use the Bode plot function with a non-Siglent waveform generator. After some hours of researching and reverse engineering I wrote this Python program which is a small server which emulates Siglent arbitrary waveform generator.

The oscilloscope connects using LAN to a PC running this program. The program makes the oscilloscope think that it communicates with a genuine Siglent signal generator. The program extracts the oscilloscope's commands, translates them to the language used by the target AWG, and then sends them to the AWG.

This tool can also be used to control the supported AWGs via other VISA tools, independently of a Siglent scope. It supports discovery over the network.

The current version of the program was tested under Linux and MacOS only. It will likely work under Windows too, with an up to date python version.

## Supported AWG Models

Right now the program supports the following models:

* **AD9910 Arduino Shield** [DDS AD9910 Shield](https://gra-afch.com/catalog/rf-units/dds-ad9910-arduino-shield/).

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```ad9910```,  ```<port>``` must be a serial port. See below.

* **BK Precision BK4075** One channel 25MHz AWG. It connects to the PC via USB. It uses a serial driver, but you might also be able to get this AWG working via a visa driver.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```bk4075```,  ```<port>``` must be a serial port. You must also provide ```baud_rate``` if you use another speed than 19200. See below.

* **Rigol DG800/DG900/DG1000Z series (like the DG811..DG992 and DG1062Z)**. (Not suitable for the Pro series, see below) When "liberated", those are  2 channel up to 100MHz AWGs with USB and ethernet interface [^1], that talks a dialect of the SCPI 1992.0 standard. There may be other devices that use this same dialect, so you may be able to use this driver for other AWGs.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```dg800```,  ```<port>``` must be a Visa compatible connection string, be it USB or ethernet. See below.

    [^1]: On the DG800/DG900, the ethernet interface requires a suitable adapter. It is however strongly recommended to use this interface.

* **Rigol DG800/DG900 Pro series**. Newer version of the above.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```dg800p```,  ```<port>``` must be a Visa compatible connection string, be it USB or ethernet. See below.

* **Feeltech FYxxxx** A range of AWGs available in various bandwidths. It connects to the PC via USB. This driver is a newer driver that has some improvements over the older FY6600 driver, and supports FY2300, FY6600, FY6800, the older FY6900 and probably more.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```fy```,  ```<port>``` must be a serial port. See below.

* **Feeltech FY6600** This is a 2 channel AWG that is available in various bandwidths (15 to 60 MHz). It connects to the PC via USB. This is an older driver that has less checking. Use it when the above drivers do not work. This will however mean that some changes to the above drivers might be needed.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```fy6600```,  ```<port>``` must be a serial port. See below.

* **Feeltech FY6900** This is a 2 channel AWG that is available in various bandwidths (20 to 100 MHz). It connects to the PC via USB. This driver has some improvements that are needed for the later FY6900 versions, that require the frequency to be sent as Hz instead of uHz. For the rest, it is the same driver as the generic FY driver.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```fy6900```,  ```<port>``` must be a serial port. See below.

* **HP 8116A** This is a single channel 1 mHz-50 MHz Pulse/Function Generator. This driver might also work for other AWGs of the same age from HP. It uses a HP-IB (GPIB) interface, and is to be connected to the PC via a GPIB adapter (PCIe/USB/Serial/Ethernet/...).

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```hp8116a```,  ```<port>``` must either be valid VISA connection string, or a instrument address of 1 to 30, in which case the VISA string will be ```GPIB0::{port}::INSTR```. See below.

* **RD/JOY-IT JDS6600** This is a 2 channel AWG that is available in various bandwidths (15 to 60 MHz). It connects to the PC via USB. This driver may also work on others from the same series, like the JDS2900.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```jds6600```,  ```<port>``` must be a serial port. See below.

* **JunTek/JOY-IT PSG9080** This is a 2 channel 80MHz AWG. It connects to the PC via USB. This driver might also work with the PSG9080B and PSG9060.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```psg9080```,  ```<port>``` must be a serial port. See below.

* **Siglent SDG1000 (SDG1010, SDG1020, SDG1050)**. This is a 2 channel AWG that is available in various bandwidths (10 to 50 MHz). Although it is a Siglent AWG, it seems to have some communication problems with the newer Siglent scopes. This driver solves that.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```sdg1050```,  ```<port>``` must be a Visa compatible connection string, for USB. See below.
* **Uni-Trend UTG1000X (like the UTG1022X)** This is a 2 channel 20 or 40MHz AWG. It connects to the PC via USB, and talks a dialect of the SCPI 1992.0 standard. There may be other devices that use this same dialect, so you may be able to use this driver for other AWGs, especially those from Uni-T.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```utg1000x```,  ```<port>``` must be a Visa compatible connection string. See below.

* **Uni-Trend UTG900E (like the UTG932E)** This is a 2 channel 30 or 60MHz AWG. It connects to the PC via USB, and talks a dialect of the SCPI 1992.0 standard, that is very much like the UTG1000X series, but has less error checking in it, so this might be the driver to use when you have older Uni-T devices.

  ```<awg_name>``` must be ```utg900e```,  ```<port>``` must be a Visa compatible connection string. See below.

## Oscilloscope Configuration

Before starting the program, you have to tell the oscilloscope how to connect to the waveform generator. Connect your oscilloscope to the same network where your PC is connected. Then go to ```Configure => AWG I/O``` in the Bode plot settings. Define LAN connection and the IP addres of your PC as the AWG IP. Please keep ```Amplitude Unit``` to ```Vpp```. This program does not (yet) support other units.

When you start the program, it will first test the communication between the PC and the configured AWG, and then starts listening to any oscilloscope or VISA commands. If you want to 'dry test', use the ```dummy``` AWG driver.

Once the program is up and running, you can press the ```Test Connection``` button on the oscilloscope to test the communication between the oscilloscope and the PC.

## Requirements

To run this program you must have Python 3.8+ installed. Python 2.7 is not supported anymore.

You will need the following pip packages:

* ```pyserial```
* ```PyVISA```
* ```PyVISA-py```

If you have an old python version, you may also need to upgrade the ```typing_extensions``` version (as required by PyVISA-py).

You should not need to install any other VISA drivers.

Under Linux, Python ```sockets``` requires elevated privileges, therefore the program has to be run with ```su``` or ```sudo```, or better, allow python access with a command like ```sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE+ep' /bin/python3.10``` (to be adapted to your situation). On MacOS and Windows you likely will not need all this.

## Running The Program

The program must be run in a command line terminal.

In order to run it, change the current path to the directory where you downloaded the source code. Then write the following command:

```sh
python3 sds1004x_bode <awg_name> [<port>] [<baud_rate>] [-h] [-v[v[v]]] [-1]
```

or (legacy form):

```sh
cd sds1004x_bode
python3 bode.py <awg_name> [<port>] [<baud_rate>] [-h] [-v[v[v]]] [-1]
```

where

* ```<awg_name>``` is the name of the AWG connected to your PC: ```ad9910```, ```bk4075```, ```dg800```, ```dg800p```,  ```fy```, ```fy6900```, ```fy6600```, ```hp8116a```, ```psg9080```, ```jds6600```, ```sdg1050```, ```utg900e```, ```utg1000x``` or ```dummy```.
  
  If you do not specify ```<awg_name>```, the program will use the ```dummy``` configuration: this can be used to test communication with the oscilloscope. The program will then emulate a Siglent AWG and the oscilloscope will generate a Bode plot but no commands will be sent to any AWG.

* ```<port>``` is the port to which your AWG is connected. The type depends on your AWG, see the explanations above.

  For serial port AWGs, it will be something like ```/dev/ttyUSB0``` or ```/dev/ttyACM0```.

  If you use one of the SCPI compatible devices like the ```dg800```, ```dg800p```, ```sdg1050```, ```utg900e```, or ```utg1000x```, you must specify a Visa compatible connection string, like ```TCPIP::192.168.001.204::INSTR``` or ```USB0::9893::6453::DG1234567890A::0::INSTR```. The ```hp8116a``` driver will also accept an instrument address (1 to 30), in which case it will look for the instrument under ```GPIB0::{port}::INSTR```.

  If you use the ```dummy``` generator, you don't have to specify the port.

* ```<baud_rate>``` The serial baud rate as defined in the AWG settings. ```bk4075``` uses a default speed of 19200. All others run on 115200 baud or on Visa, and this parameter will be ignored for them.

* Use ```-h``` for help text.

* Use ```-1``` to exit the program after one bode plot is done. It looks for the "OUTP OFF" command or inactivity for more than 10 seconds after a start of a bode plot. If ```-1``` is not specified, the program will run until Ctrl-C is used.

* Use ```-v``` or ```-vv``` or ```-vvv``` for logging verbosity. The first logs the driver info, the next also logs VXI-11 info, the last also logs port mapper info. By default, only the startup phase and the incoming commands are logged.

If the program starts successfully, and with ```-vvv```, you'll see the following output:

```text
Initializing AWG...
AWG: jds6600
Port: /dev/ttyUSB0
IDN: jds6600
AWG initialized.
Starting AWG server...
Portmapper: Listening to UDP and TCP ports on 0.0.0.0:111
VXI-11: Listening to TCP port 0.0.0.0:9010
```

After starting the program, follow the usual procedure of creating Bode plot. After starting the plotting, the program output will be similar to the following (when using ```-vvv```):

```text

```

When done, you can stop the process via Ctrl-C. You can also specify the parameter `-1` to stop the process once one bode plot is done .

## Some possible errors

If you get an error message with  ```Address already in use. Cannot use ... for listening.```, use ```netstat``` or ```lsof``` to look what process is already using the port. It might be because you have nfs.server running via rpcbind. For that case, just disable it while running the bode plot: ```sudo systemctl stop rpcbind.socket rpcbind.service```.

If you see a warning message with `VI_WARN_CONFIG_NLOADED`, that probably means you have installed a lower level VISA driver, and have not provided a config file for it. Know that it is unlikely that you'd need a VISA driver (apart from the above mentioned python packages). So in order to suppress the warning message, either add the config file (sorry, that depends on the driver you installed, too many variants out there), or better, remove the VISA driver, unless you need that driver with other tools.

## Support for other AWGs and Contributing

I'd like to add more AWGs but it's impossible to have them all at the home lab, so I have to rely on your cooperation for the adding of more drivers.

If you have an AWG that is not listed, but is compatible with one of the existing drivers (which is more easily the case with SCPI AWGs of the same brand), tell us so (via github Issue or Pull request), so that we can add the device to the list.

If you have an AWG that is not compatible, you often can create a new driver easily by using one of the existing drivers as example. Especially SCPI drivers are easy to do. Again, please tell us if you have done so (via github Issue or Pull request), so that we can add the driver.

For driver testing, you can use [```awg_tests.py```](/sds1004x_bode/tests/awg_tests.py). Adapt it to your device and address, and it will test all commands.

## Using independently from the scope, via VISA

This is possible, but you should set a large timeout on your ```Instrument``` or when using ```open_resource()``` when using serial AWGs. See the example in [```testSCPI.py```](/sds1004x_bode/tests/testSCPI.py)
